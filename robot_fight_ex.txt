Ok So Lest me explain something to you
Here in the Terminal, ANYTHING is possible
So your now about to fight a big robot, thankfully to make the fight easier, you have some abilities
Ill explain how they work, and the damage FunctionIt can get confusing so listen carefully.
So you get the first show, and you can choose out of three (basic, poisin, and chance)
Firstly, a Normal shot will be done by basically rolling two dice, and you do the multiplication of the two numbers as damage
So if you get a 3 and a 6 you will do 18 damage
Poisin rolls four dice, it multiples the first two rolls, and adds the product of the second two
So if you were to roll the same 3 and 6 twice, you would to 18 + 18 damageThe thing is, your damage is capped at 15, and the rest goes towards the next round as 'poisin'
You will do your total posin damage divided by 5 ontop of your round damage each round
Lastly, your chance shot, you get a 1 in 30 chance to guess a number, if you get it, you win instantly, otherwise you DIE 
be smart! This bot will put up a fight
You both start with 100.0 health
Goodluck..
FIGHTERS,
TAKE YOUR POSITIONS
LESS GOOOOOOOOOO
