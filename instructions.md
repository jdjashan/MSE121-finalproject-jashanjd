Robot Fight Game 

Certain story selections lead you to a robot fight game, this is how you play 

Read the story and make sure you understand how to attack, and what the shots do, as a little review: 

Basic Shot: Two random numbers (1-6) multiplied by each other 

Poison Shot: Four Random numbers (1-6), a, b, c, and d. These numbers  are added as such: a*c + b*d but are capped at 15 damage. The left-over damage is added to a poison damage counter. This counter will do a fifth of its damage each round 

Chance Shot: A 1 in 15 chance to just win the fight right then and there, but if you lose, you are out of the game 

The game will start, and you will be given the option to perform a basic, poison, or chance shot.  

Choose accordingly with the number associations, and take your shot 

Make sure you think about your strategy before taking your shots, maybe you can stack poison or just go for all basic 

You keep going until wither you win, or the robot kills you 

Goodluck!
