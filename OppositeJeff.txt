You walk approx. N42.069E with hopes to 'Collect Some Items?' or 'Win Some Games'
1 minute, 1 hour, or even 1 week. You have no idea how long you have been walking
There is no concept of time Here
But there is also no concept of survival either, your not hungry, your not tired, just super bored
A very smart man once said: 'Insanity was doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results' 
You Knew You Had to make a choice, because walking aimlessly was not working
In that moment your call was heard
In the corner of your eye you see a light, something 'different'
But in your other hand in the you here something from your left ear, sounds like 'people', 'real people'...
Maybe
Well Now you got to choose which to go for
..........................................
Type 1 to Go Towards the light
Type 2 to Go Towards the Sound of 'people'
Type 3 to try to call the people over instead of going towards them
