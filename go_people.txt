you walk towards the people, and you realise it really is people
but what are they doing, just standing in a circle whispering random words
one of them turns thier head and sees you
they suprisingly wave you over and you join
You: 'Who are you guys'
Person 1: 'Hey, we are just here to teach you the importance of making the correct connections in life'
Person 1: 'I am a little nerdy, but I know how to solve any question'
Person 2: 'I am Sporty, dont talk to me unless you play sports'
Person 3: 'I love video games, come vibe on some fortine with me'
Person 4: 'I am a loverboy, gimme all the girls!' 
Person 5: 'I love dance, and all the arts, they are so creative'
Person 6: 'I just wanna be rich, I DONT CARE HOWWWW...'
Person 7: 'Im super shy'
Ok, so look at your personality type, who could you be freinds with? (Enter Numer, dont add person)
