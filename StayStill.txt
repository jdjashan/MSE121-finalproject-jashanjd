What was, what is, what ever will be.
In the Dark
Without a Spark
When One Must Find The light
But is Stuck with so Much Fright
What is Gone is Forever
This is quite an Enedvour
You Look Up and You Look Down
Only to Find Yourself with a Frown
Next Thing You know, you Dont
You wanna try, but you wont
You: '- Ok Dr Suess'

You: 'Yea Dummy, I hear everything, so stop rhyming and tell the user what to do next'
You: 'Or I guess what I should do Next'
Fine fine, I gotta fix this bug, anyways, now that you know im here I guess Ill give you a 1 in 20 chance to escape
But If you fail, YOU DIE
Or Ill just point you in the right Direction  
..............................................
Type 1 to roll for the escape
Type 2 to Get `pointed` in the right direction
